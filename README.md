# Job-Application-Save-Bot

<h3> Using Selenium to automatically save the first job that I have filtered.</h3>
<p><br> This involves an analysis of Linkedin and it's index properties especially with 
  Selenium's NoSuchElementException that gets raised when an element cannot be found.
  I also had to accomodate for the captcha phrase which pops up some times to spot bots on Linkedin using tests.
